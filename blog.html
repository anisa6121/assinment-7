 <p class="mt-5 fs-4 text-warning">1 : Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage </p>
 <p class="text-danger"><span class="text-dark fw-bold">LocalStorage:</span>
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the
amount of traffic between client and server.
The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current
and future visits to the site ​   <br>
<span class="text-dark fw-bold">sessionStorage:</span>
It is similar to localStorage.
Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available
for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is
deleted
The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​

<p class="fs-4 text-warning">2 : What is the difference between global scope and block scope? </p>

<p class="text-danger">
<span class="text-dark fw-bold">The Global scope: </span>

A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it
exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside
blocks.

<br>
<span class="text-dark fw-bold">The Local scope</span>

In contrast to global variables, locally scoped ones are only visible within the function they are declared. Each
function written in JavaScript creates a new local scope and every variable declared in this scope is a local variable.
That means that variables with the same name can be used in different functions. However, any effort to reference a
local variable outside its scope will result in a Reference Error:

    <p class="text-warning fs-2">3 Event Loop in JavaScript: </p>

    <p class="text-danger">
JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one thing at a time. JavaScript executes all
operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The
event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. <br>
JavaScript engine executes a script from the top and works its way down creating execution contexts and pushing and
popping functions onto and off the call stack.

<br>
The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
