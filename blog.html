 <p class="text-danger"><span class="text-dark fw-bold">LocalStorage:</span>
Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the
amount of traffic between client and server.
The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current
and future visits to the site ​   <br>
<span class="text-dark fw-bold">sessionStorage:</span>
It is similar to localStorage.
Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available
for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is
deleted
The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set​
